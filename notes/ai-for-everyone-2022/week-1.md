## What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

One of the leading AI textbooks is [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](https://zoo.cs.yale.edu/classes/cs470/materials/aima2010.pdf) [PDF, 20.9 MB], by `Stuart Russell` and `Peter Norvig`. In the book, they delve into four potential goals or definitions of AI, which differentiate computer systems as follows:

- Human approach
  - Systems that think like humans
  - Systems that act like humans
- Ideal approach:
  - Systems that think rationally
  - Systems that act rationally

In its simplest form, artificial intelligence is a field that combines computer science and robust datasets to enable problem-solving. AI today includes the sub-fields of machine learning and deep learning, which are frequently mentioned in conjunction with artificial intelligence. These disciplines are comprised of AI algorithms that typically make predictions or classifications based on input data. Machine learning has improved the quality of some expert systems, and made it easier to create them.[^1]

A -> B Input to Output Mappings


Acquiring Data
- Manual labeling
- From observing behaviors
- Download from websites / partnerships

Data is messy
- Garbage in, garbage out
- Data problems (incorrect labels, missing values)
- Multiple types of data (images, audio, text)

Structured, unstructured
